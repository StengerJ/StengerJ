 Hi, I am Joshua Stenger! Currently, I am a Computer Science student(Bachelors of Science) at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, Pa.
 My interests during my studies are Backend Developement and Machine Learning.
 From time to time I also enjoy using Unreal Engine to experiment with video game creation.
 On my github is a static website that will have all of my personal projects posted(once complete).
 Please feel free to check out all code submitted onto this profile, but while all of my personal projects will be self created,
 the website where I post my projects is not. It was created from a MOSH youtube tutorial over my freshman Christmas break. (Credit to MOSH)

 Thank you for stopping by and checking out my profile!
