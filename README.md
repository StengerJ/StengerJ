  Hi, I am Joshua Stenger! Currently, I am a Computer Science student(Bachelors of Science) at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, Pa. <br/>
  My interests during my studies are Backend Developement, Machine Learning and Robotics.<br/>
  From time to time I also enjoy using Unreal Engine to experiment with video game creation.<br/>
  On my github is a static website that will have all of my personal projects posted(once complete).<br/>
  Please feel free to check out all code submitted onto this profile, but while all of my personal projects will be self created,
  the website where I post my projects is not.<br/>
  It was created from a MOSH youtube tutorial over my freshman Christmas break. (Credit to MOSH)<br/>
 
  Thank you for stopping by and checking out my profile!<br/>
